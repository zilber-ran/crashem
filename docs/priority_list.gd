the tower, which poses as the players health. When an enemy reaches the tower it 
attacks it and lowers it's HP. When the tower's HP drops to 0 the game ends with
the player losing.

The game works on a turn based system, on the player's turn they launch themselves 
towards the enemies. Enemies hit will lose health or die. After the player stopped moving
it becomes the enemies' turn: moving, spawning new enemies and attacking the tower.
Enemies will gradually get more difficult as the game progresses.

On higher levels of progress the player gets access to more balls
enabling it to use them to attack more enemies per turn.

The game runs constantly, with a set objective for every phase of the game. The player
might be tasked with protecting the tower form a wave of incoming enemies, or covering 
the tower and shielding form enemies as it moves from point A to B. Another task might
be attacking enemy bases, with no concern for the tower at that -
